                <p>JavaScript isn’t Java. There! With that clarification out of the way,
                   you can move on to bigger, more important learning, like how to make
                  cool sliders. In all seriousness, JavaScript is one implementation
                   of a specification known as ECMAScript. You’ll learn more about 
                   ECMAScript later in this chapter.Where did JavaScript come from? 
                   You might not know the rich and storied history of JavaScript—
                 and you might not really care much about it, either. If that’s the
                 case, you might be tempted to jump ahead to the next chapter and begin 
                 coding JavaScript. Doing so, of course, would be a mistake— you’d miss all
                 the wonderful information that follows in this chapter. And understanding
                 a bit about the history of JavaScript is important to understanding how
                 the language is implemented in various environments today.
                 JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich at Netscape sometime 
                 in 1995–1996. Bacthen, the language was called LiveScript. That was a great
                  name for a new language—and the story could have ended there. However, in 
                  an unfortunate decision, the folks in marketing had their way,
                 and the language was renamed to JavaScript. Confusion soon ensued. You see,
                  Java was the exciting new language at the time, and someone decided to try
                 to capitalize on Java’s popularity by using its name. As a result, JavaScript
                  found itself associated with the Java language

                  1. Open a web browser.<br>
                  2.In the address bar, type the following code and press Enter:<br>
                  javascript:alert("Hello World");
                After you press Enter, you see a dialog box similar to this one:<BR>
                    <BR>
                        <BR>
                HELLO WORLD
                </p>
